Inkscape Set Up
===============

Files in this directory are used to configure Inkscape for drawing math notes. 


doc-templates
-------------
Document templates to determine initial doc properties---i.e. what can be specified in
the File -> Document Properties dialog.  You can create one by opening a new document, 
setting the desired props in the dialog then saving the file to:
  
  * ~/Library/Application\ Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/inkscape/templates/

The template will appear in the File -> New from Template dialog.

doc-templates contains my templates; they should be copied over to the above directory
before they can be used, obviously.

Also, if a 'default.svg' template exists in 

 * ~/Library/Application\ Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/inkscape/templates/

it will be used for new documents when Inkscape starts.  So make a sym link to point to
the template to use for new docs, e.g.

  * cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/inkscape/templates/
  * ln -s Blackboard.svg default.svg


palettes
--------
color palettes, should go into (not verified):

  * ~/Library/Application\ Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/inkscape/palettes/

Saving here Echo Icon Theme palette which ships with 0.91 so that it can be restored 
if the next version doesn't have it.  Currently using this palette for all diagrams,
either black or white background.
 

preferences
-----------
preference files to specify tools props. 

  * blackboard.preferences.xml: set up to go with Blackboard documents.
  * white-bg.preferences.xml: set up to go with white background docs.

to install one preference set, override:

  * ~/Library/Application\ Support/org.inkscape.Inkscape/inkscape/preferences.xml


symbols
-------
symbols libraries.
