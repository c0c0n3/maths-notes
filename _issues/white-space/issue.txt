ISSUE: text rendering in Chrome
======

Platform
--------
Windows 7, Inkscape 0.91, Chrome '40.0.2214.115 m' and '41.0.2272.76 m'


Description
-----------
If a text block in SVG is styled with 'white-space:normal;', words will overlap.
Open test.svg in Chrome for an example.
(Note that Internet Explorer 11 renders the text correctly.)

Notes
-----
Something must have changed in my Inkscape internal settings on Windows (Inkscape version 0.91)
and now Inkscape started adding 'white-space:normal;' to the style of my text.
Until a few days ago, Inkscape (0.91, same build) would not add that style to the text.
for example see categories/cat-of-all-cats/commutative-squares/com-squares-in-prod-cat.svg:
text in there has no 'white-space:normal;' style...
